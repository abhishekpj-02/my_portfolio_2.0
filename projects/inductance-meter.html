  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This project implements an Arduino-based inductance meter that measures
    unknown inductance values using the principle of LC resonance and
    frequency measurement.
  </p>

  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>
    Measuring inductance accurately using basic instruments can be difficult
    and expensive. This project aims to provide a low-cost and simple method
    to measure inductance using commonly available components.
  </p>

  <h3>Working Principle</h3>
  <p>
    An LC tank circuit is formed using a known capacitor and the unknown
    inductor. The resonant frequency of the circuit is measured using a
    comparator-based signal conditioning stage and processed by the Arduino
    to calculate the inductance value.
  </p>

  <h3>Circuit Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    The circuit consists of an LC resonant network, a comparator for waveform
    shaping, and an Arduino microcontroller for frequency measurement and
    computation.
  </p>

  <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Arduino</li>
    <li>LC Resonant Circuits</li>
    <li>Comparator (Signal Conditioning)</li>
    <li>Embedded C</li>
    <li>Analog Electronics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why This Project Matters</h3>
  <p>
    This project strengthened my understanding of analog electronics,
    signal conditioning, and microcontroller-based measurement systems.
    It bridges theoretical concepts with practical implementation.
  </p>

  <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    Accuracy can be improved using better frequency resolution, calibration,
    temperature compensation, and a refined PCB-based design.
