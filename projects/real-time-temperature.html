    <!-- Overview -->
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This project implements a real-time temperature measurement system using a
      microcontroller and temperature sensor. The system continuously monitors
      temperature variations and provides live readings for analysis and monitoring.
    </p>

    <!-- Problem -->
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Accurate temperature monitoring is essential in applications such as
      environmental monitoring, electronics safety, and industrial systems.
      Conventional solutions often lack real-time visibility or rely on expensive
      equipment.
    </p>

    <!-- Solution -->
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>
      A temperature sensor is interfaced with a microcontroller to capture temperature
      data at regular intervals. The readings are processed in real time and displayed
      locally and remotely for continuous monitoring.
    </p>

    <!-- Working -->
    <h3>Working Principle</h3>
    <p>
      The temperature sensor generates an electrical signal proportional to the
      surrounding temperature. The microcontroller reads this signal, converts it into
      a temperature value, and updates the output in real time.
    </p>

    <!-- Technologies -->
    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP)</li>
      <li>Temperature Sensor</li>
      <li>Embedded C</li>
      <li>Analog & Digital Electronics</li>

      class="project-hero"
      alt="Circuit diagram for real-time temperature measurement system"
    >
    <p>
      The circuit consists of a temperature sensor connected to a microcontroller.
      The sensor output is processed and converted into temperature values, enabling
      continuous real-time monitoring.

    <!-- Dashboard -->
    <h3>Real-Time Dashboard</h3>

      class="project-hero"
      alt="Real-time temperature monitoring dashboard"
    >
    <p>
      This dashboard provides live visualization of temperature and humidity data
      transmitted from the sensor node to the Blynk Cloud platform. It displays body
      temperature, ambient room temperature, and humidity using gauge widgets, along
      with a status indicator for quick interpretation of readings.
    </p>

    <!-- Importance -->
    <h3>Why This Project Matters</h3>
    <p>
      This project strengthened my understanding of sensor interfacing, real-time data
      acquisition, and embedded system design. It demonstrates how reliable sensing
      plays a critical role in real-world applications.
    </p>

    <!-- Future -->
    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
    <p>
      The system can be extended by adding wireless communication, cloud-based data
      logging, mobile alerts, and multi-sensor integration for large-scale monitoring.
