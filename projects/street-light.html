  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This project focuses on designing an intelligent street lighting system
    where lights automatically turn ON only when a vehicle or object is detected,
    helping reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency.
  </p>

  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>
    Traditional street lights remain ON throughout the night regardless of traffic,
    leading to unnecessary power consumption. This project aims to address that
    inefficiency using sensing and control logic.
  </p>

  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>
    Motion sensors are used to detect the presence of a vehicle on the road.
    When a vehicle is detected, nearby street lights are activated, and they
    automatically turn OFF once the vehicle moves away.
  </p>

  <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Embedded Systems</li>
    <li>Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP)</li>
    <li>Motion Sensors</li>
    <li>IoT Concepts</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>System Architecture</h3>

<p>
  The system consists of multiple ESP32-based nodes equipped with sensors
  to detect vehicle movement. Sensor data is communicated between nodes
  over HTTP, enabling coordinated control of street lights along the road.
</p>


  <h3>Why This Project Matters</h3>
  <p>
    This project solves a real-world social problem by reducing power wastage
    and promoting sustainable infrastructure. It also sparked my deeper interest
    in embedded systems and intelligent automation.
  </p>

  <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    Integration with wireless communication, centralized monitoring,
    and intelligent decision-making can further enhance scalability
    and efficiency.
